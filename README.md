# Gitalytics

Live - (In Development)

Gitalytics runs a Node.js server and utilizes Github's Api to gather data and visualize a user's code behavior with D3.js.

### Technologies:
  - Node.js
  - React/Redux
  - D3.js

### Setup:

After cloning the repo, `npm install` then `npm start` to run the server. `nodemon` is installed to restart the local server when changes are made on the backend. Run `webpack -w` and go to `localhost:3000` on your preferred browser.

### How to Use
Input a Github username and the type of information you want back and a chart will be generated.
